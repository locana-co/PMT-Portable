# User Instructions

Doubleclick "StartApplication.bat" and follow the instructions to start prepare the environment for the application.

- It's in the instructions, but the command to enter into Node when it starts is: ``node api.js usb``

- All command windows and applications that are opened during the startup process must stay open for the duration of application use. Though they can be minimized. And this does not apply to "StartApplication.bat".

- If for any reason one of the component stops working during application use. A script has been provided for each individual component. Just doubleclick the "Restart"application command file and follow the instrucitons to get everything back up and running.

- To edit the target directory for the API (node). Edit the file node/nodejs-portable.conf to have the working path and custom path that matches the correct output directory.

- To edit the target directory for the web server (application). Edit the file server/settings/usbwebserver.ini to have a root path that matches the correct output directory. You can also use the user interface found in your running applications panel of your computer's taskbar.
