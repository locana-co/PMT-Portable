PMT-Portable
============

First attempt at a portable portfolio mapping database on a stick. The idea is to run in conjunction with an offline node/webkit server to act as a desktop applicaiton. 

First go get the latest windows binaries from here: 
http://www.enterprisedb.com/postgresql-934-binaries-win64?ls=Crossover&type=Crossover

Go get the latest PostGIS binaries
http://download.osgeo.org/postgis/windows/pg93/postgis-bundle-pg93x64-setup-2.1.1-1.exe

Find a USB and copy the postgres binaries on to it.
install postgis directly on the mounted usb.

Edit the batch script(s) to change the directory and go.
